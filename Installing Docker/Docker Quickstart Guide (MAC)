# Docker Quickstart Guide (MAC)
### Installing the Docker Toolbox
1. Go to https://www.docker.com/toolbox 
1. Run the Docker Toolbox installer, entering your password when prompted.
1. If you already have Boot2Docker installed (now deprecated): You will be asked if you want to migrate your previous vm, choose "migrate".

### Running Docker containers 
1. There are two ways you can start running containers with docker:
	1. From the Docker Quickstart Terminal
		* Find "Docker Quickstart Terminal" from your Application folder or Launchpad, double click to launch.
		* A terminal window will open. This is where you will be able to issue docker commands.
		* Verify that your setup succeeded by running `docker run hello-world` (requires an internet connection)
		* Docker will download a new image onto your computer and run it, producing the following output:

		```
		$ docker run hello-world
		Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
		511136ea3c5a: Pull complete
		31cbccb51277: Pull complete
		e45a5af57b00: Pull complete
		hello-world:latest: The image you are pulling has been verified.
		Important: image verification is a tech preview feature and should not be
		relied on to provide security.
		Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
		Hello from Docker.
		This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


		To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
		1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
		2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
		   (Assuming it was not already locally available.)
		3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
		   executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
		4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
		   to your terminal.


		To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
		$ docker run -it ubuntu bash


		For more examples and ideas, visit:
		http://docs.docker.com/userguide/
		```

1. If you prefer to use a graphic user interface instead, you may use Kitematic (included in the Docker Toolbox)
	1. To use Kitematic, you will need to create a Docker Hub account, you may do so at https://hub.docker.com
	1. Search for "hello-world" on the search bar, click the create button of the "official:hello-world" repository. The repository will be downloaded.
	1. Again, we can verify that our setup is successful by observing the output of your container logs.
